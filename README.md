# KNN-with-fixed-cluster-size
Algorithm to cluster points using KNN with additional condition of fixed cluster size.


Step 1 : Clsuter the data points using KNN and number of cluster required.

Step 2 : Rearrnge points which are furthest from the assigned cluster and nearest to another cluster until cluster size is achieved.

Step 3 : Try to evaluate the global minimum by reevaluating the clusters are reassigning the points.
